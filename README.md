**EDUCATION**. The   data   we   will   analyze   can   be   found   on:https://databank.worldbank.org/source/education-statistics-%5E-all-indicators We want to analyze the educational system in Morocco.  For this, we wouldlike to understand the current state of the Moroccan educational system andto uncover some insights about it. This will require us to use economic,demographic and educational data in Morocco and in other countries as amatter of comparison.

**The main questions are :** 
* What is the current state of the educational systemo
  * What is the literacy rate in Morocco?
  * What is the average educational level of the country? (The PISAand  the  PIAAC  tests  are  good   indicators  of  the  level   inmathematics, reading and science)
  * What significant factors should we focus on to ameliorate the current situation?

In order to answer these questions, we would have to conduct a whole analysis and to answer to various sub-questions, such as : 
* How does Morocco compare to the other countries in theworld? 
* How does it compare to African countries?
* Do these factors have a link with the countryâ€™s GDP? We coulduse the government expenditure on education as a % of GDP to look at the efficiency of each educational system aroundthe world.
* Do they depend on variables such as 
  * Population
  * Sex
  * Urban or Rural
  * Age
  * Teacher salaries
  * Drop-out rates 
  * Net enrollment rates in primary, secondary, uppersecondary school
