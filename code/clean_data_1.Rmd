## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars,  include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(extrafont)
library(ggtext)
library(janitor)
library(ggthemes)
library(dplyr)
library(countrycode)
library(ggplot2)
loadfonts(device="win")
```

## Clean Data

```{r data cleaning}
data <- read.csv("Data visualization final data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

#change name
colnames(data)[1] <- "country"

#select time
data1 <- data %>% 
  select(country:series_code,x2000_yr2000:x2020_yr2020)

#change names
colnames(data1)[5:25] <- c(2000:2020)

#pivot longer
data2 <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data1, cols = "2000":"2020", names_to = "Year", values_to = "count")

#set the missing data as NA
data2[data2 == ".."] <- NA

#add continent information
data2$continent <- countrycode(sourcevar = data2$country,
                               origin = "country.name",
                               destination = "continent")

#variable lists
all_variables <- data %>% distinct(series)
```

# Plot1

```{r literacy rate, warning = FALSE}
