## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars,  include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(extrafont)
library(ggtext)
library(janitor)
library(ggthemes)
library(dplyr)
library(countrycode)
library(ggplot2)
```

Holding GDP per capita constant (or in other words, choosing countries that had similar GDP per capita range to Morocco), we wanted to know whether government spending on healthcare and secondary schools had a major impact on the average PISA score for each country. It is seen that Vietnam is doing so much better compared to Morocco, governments are spending less on seconday education and healthcare BUT their PISA score is so much higher. It is inevitable to realise that with relatively the same GDP per capita, Morocco is doing the worst. Does this mean that the governments are spending their money at the wrong place?
